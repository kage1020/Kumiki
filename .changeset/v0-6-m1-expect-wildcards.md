v0.6 M1 (#49) — `reducer-test` `expect` wildcards (`spec/testing.md` §8.2.2). `<any-id>` matches any generated value (and, as a map key, pairs with exactly one otherwise-unmatched entry), and `<slots.X>` matches slot X's post-execution value (e.g. `effects: [persist(<slots.todos>)]`). Matching is otherwise exact — wildcards only blank out non-deterministic holes. A wildcard outside a `reducer-test` `expect` is a compile error (new E0109 `test-wildcard-misuse`).
